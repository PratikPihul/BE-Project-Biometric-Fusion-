modules used in project :-
Ear biometrics :- 
1: Tensorflow = To train the model 
2: Opencv = To read images
3: Numpy = To perform matrics operations on image 
4: Matplotlib = To plot image 

Fingerprint biometrics :-
1: Opencv = To read images
2: Numpy = To perform matrics operations on image

Info:-
Ear biometrics :-

Model is trained on the images stores in train folder and tested model on data stored in test folder
relu, softmax these are the activation functions used in neural network.
model is stored in model_opt.h5 file, to predict the image model is imported from this file.

Fingerprint biometrics :-

Sample fingerprints are stored in SOCOFing folder with different difficulties.
to match fingerprint first keypoints and discriptors are collected from image, then using knnmatch function points are match with each image in storage.
knnmatch function finds the k best matches for each descriptor from a query set.
then based on the error in both matches fingerprint image is matched.
and all matched points are shown in the end.
